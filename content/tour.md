      <h3>Made for Mobile</h3>
      <p>
        Today’s modern workforce is constantly connected to their smartphone. That’s why we made WorkBright’s digital onboarding not just ‘mobile friendly’ but mobile FIRST, specifically designed to complete all forms quickly and efficiently from any smart enabled device. Even administrators can approve, reject and countersign I-9s from their mobile device!

      <h3>Fingertip Signature</h3>
      <p>
        A typed "signature" in a generic font isn’t a best practice for legal or federal forms. WorkBright utilizes best-in-class e-signature technology by fingertip on a smartphone or by mouse on a computer, making sure the signature on your forms looks the same as the employee’s pen signature. This decreases your liability of signatures not being accepted in a court of law so you can sleep better at night!

      <h3>Photo Upload</h3>
      <p>
        WorkBright allows your employees to use their smartphone camera to take a photo of licenses, certificates, and/or paper documents and directly upload them to their employee file. This functionality eliminates the need for photo copies, ensures employees have the correct and up to date certifications, and completes the mobile experience.

      <h3>Automated Email Reminders</h3>
      <p>
        No more chasing down employees to complete forms! WorkBright will automatically send out reminder emails to employees who have not completed their forms with increasing urgency and frequency as their first day approaches. Emails are customized to the employee to list forms pending and with links directly to their account to complete.

      <h3>Smart I-9</h3>
      <p>
      I-9 compliance is a major concern for all HR departments. With WorkBright’s Smart I-9™, we guide your employees through this otherwise complicated form in an easy-to-follow wizard format with field validation to ensure proper completion. Administrators can even countersign I-9s one-by-one or in bulk on the first day of work!

  <h3>Employee Error Resolution</h3>
  <p>
    WorkBright helps ensure your employee files are accurate and up to date in two ways. First, we incorporate field validation to help avoid errors up front. Next, if an employee does submit something that is incorrect, our error correction workflow is pre-configured with automatic emails telling them what is wrong and how to fix it, as well as follow up reminders until it is resubmitted.
