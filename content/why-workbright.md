# Let’s Get Real… Traditional Onboarding Paperwork Sucks!


{{< accordion_wrapper >}}
  {{< accordion_card title="<strong>Speed</strong> collection of employees forms and certifications" id="speed" show="show">}}
    Automated email reminders increase in intensity as the new hire start date approaches so employees come in on Day 1 with all new hire paperwork already completed! Employees can even use their smart device camera to take a photo of certifications and upload directly to you!

  {{< accordion_card title="<strong>Increase</strong> accuracy in employee files" id="increase">}}
    Field validation throughout the WorkBright platform ensures your files are already cleaner when they are submitted. If an error creeps through, you can easily reject the form and fire off an automatic notification to the employee to correct the error!

  {{< accordion_card title="<strong>Reduce</strong> the number of HR personnel you need for onboarding" id="reduce">}}
    No need to staff up for mass hiring events or heavy onboarding periods! WorkBright allows you to upload employee information and deliver customized, digital paperwork in bulk to all new employees with the click of a few buttons. Reducing the time to onboard by up to 8x!

    With best-in-class security, automated field validation, document correction workflows and easily reportable employee information you can rest easy knowing your employee files are ready for a regulatory audit at any moment. No more checklists and filing cabinets!

  {{< accordion_card title="<strong>Reclaim</strong> your email inbox from employee clutter" id="reclaim">}}
    Managing employee communications and forms via your email inbox (or even worse, the physical mail) is a security and organizational nightmare! Move all employee onboarding processes into WorkBright where a secure audit trail tracks every interaction.

          <h2>Built for the contingent workforce</h2>
          <p>
            Traditional onboarding solutions do not meet the needs of organizations that rapidly hire or have a large contingent workforce. WorkBright was designed specifically for those that hire more than 50 per year, or have contract, part-time or seasonal employees. WorkBright can accommodate your increasing hiring needs without increasing your HR staff.
