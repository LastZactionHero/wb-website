          <p>

Your employees can quickly fill out forms when they need to and where they need to all before their first day of work. You will see the difference between WorkBright and other “mobile friendly” solutions is stark.

          <h2>Built for the contingent workforce</h2>
          <p>
            Traditional onboarding solutions do not meet the needs of organizations that rapidly hire or have a large contingent workforce. WorkBright was designed specifically for those that hire more than 50 per year, or have contract, part-time or seasonal employees. WorkBright can accommodate your increasing hiring needs without increasing your HR staff.
