### Safe to hire? Or NOT? How can you know?

Background checks are an essential part of the hiring process. Knowing how to evaluate and handle the reports you get back from your screening provider is essential. Equal employment policies and various Ban the Box statutes around the country require you to adopt background screening procedures that are sensitive to individual-level circumstances. Meanwhile, you must consider the risks involved in the roles you are seeking to fill.

WorkBright invites you to watch the recording of a live webinar with the background screening experts of Proforma Screening Solutions. This session will help you better understand how to evaluate the results of a background check in order to make better hiring decisions, promote fair hiring practices, and manage your risks.

### You’ll learn:

- What to check for and why
- How to evaluate background check reports against the risks of the positions you are seeking to fill
