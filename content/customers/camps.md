{{< customers_quote title="New User Loving WorkBright" name="Eryn Rothenberg" organization="Operations Manager, Triple C Camp" photo="customers/camp-quote-eryn.jpg" >}}Last year was our first year using WorkBright for our staff paperwork. We found that it was <strong>very user friendly</strong>, and our staff enjoyed getting to do it all on their computer or phones rather than sitting down filling out papers. WorkBright made it easy to <strong>keep track of who had completed what</strong> as well. We are excited to continue with WorkBright this year!{{< /customers_quote >}}
