{{< customers_quote title="New User Loving WorkBright" name="Eryn Rothenberg" organization="Operations Manager, Triple C Camp" photo="customers/camp-quote-eryn.jpg" >}}Last year was our first year using WorkBright for our staff paperwork. We found that it was very user friendly, and our staff enjoyed getting to do it all on their computer or phones rather than sitting down filling out papers. WorkBright made it easy to keep track of who had completed what as well. We are excited to continue with WorkBright this year!{{< /customers_quote >}}
