#### WorkBright Tips 

**Unlocking Forms For 2016 Adjustments!** 

Did you know that you can unlock ANY form for employees to make edits? With the new year, employees may be looking to update certain documents like the W4 to change allowances. Use your WorkBright account to simply open up the form for editing so employees can adjust and resubmit for 2016.

1. Go to the **"Forms" tab of the employee's profile.** Click into the form you'd like to allow the employee to resubmit. Next to the refect button, there's a **short menu** that includes **"Unlock to Allow Changes."**![](/images/blog/recruiting-with-social-media-auto-approve-forms-january-2016/Screen_Shot_2016_01_07_at_7.14.03_AM.png)  
  
2. When the **employee logs back in** to his or her account, unlocked forms will be approved, but **available for edit** as needed. ![](/images/blog/recruiting-with-social-media-auto-approve-forms-january-2016/Screen_Shot_2016_01_07_at_7.16.17_AM.png)  
  
3. They can **see their existing submission** and choose to stick with that, or edit and re-complete the form for submission. ![](/images/blog/recruiting-with-social-media-auto-approve-forms-january-2016/Screen_Shot_2016_01_07_at_7.16.34_AM.png)

## _New Feature:_Auto-Approve Forms!

  
  
Our mission is to save you time and we are continuously looking for ways to shave seconds off your onboarding process! One of the things YOU said saves the most time is the 'Approve' and 'Reject' workflows that administrators use when reviewing forms that have been submitted by employees. However, after setting up thousands of forms and reviewing hundreds of new hire packets, we realized that not ALL forms need this level of review before they can be added to an employees account.  
  
 ![](/images/blog/recruiting-with-social-media-auto-approve-forms-january-2016/Screen_Shot_2016_01_06_at_2.31.15_PM.png)That's why we added an 'Auto-Approve' feature that allows you to set up forms to **skip the inbox** and go directly in to your employees digital filing cabinet!  
  

**[\>\> Get A Live Tutorial Here \<\<](https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/8007108039109919746)**

  
  
By default all forms will be set to pass through the inbox for your approval. But for documents that need no review, simply uncheck the box shown above and you'll be on your way! This new functionality is perfect for signature only documents (like employee handbooks) or for census style forms (like food allergies and medication requirements). **Want to see it in action?** Join our Director of Customer Success, Peter Holter, for a live, half-hour demonstration of this new functionality on Thursday 1/21 at 10am PT!   
  

**[\>\> Register For The Demonstration Here \<\<](https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/8007108039109919746)**
 **Not a WorkBright user but want to check it out?** You're welcome to join the auto-approve demonstration but for a more comprehensive look at everything WorkBright can do, [join our half-hour group demonstration](https://workbright.com/recruiting-social-media/) next Wednesday at 11am PT.

## WorkBright Workplace: Meet Anna

  
  
 ![](/images/blog/recruiting-with-social-media-auto-approve-forms-january-2016/Anna4.jpg)Anna is the Secunda family's 12 year old golden retriever and she is also the WorkBright therapy dog! A few days each week this sweet girl brings joy into the office and curls up at the feet of one lucky WorkBrighter for a long afternoon nap. Her interests include falling asleep tummy-up in a sun spot and the long walks to and from the office with Dave. If you're ever in the Boulder area, be sure to give us a call so you can come by and meet her... and the rest of us!
