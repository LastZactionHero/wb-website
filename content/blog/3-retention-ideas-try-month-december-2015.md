## 3 Things To Try In December To Set Up For Employee Retention In 2016

  
  
It's no secret that employee turnover can take a major toll on HR resources and your Company's bottom line. Today's average worker only stays at a job for [4.4 years](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeannemeister/2012/08/14/job-hopping-is-the-new-normal-for-millennials-three-ways-to-prevent-a-human-resource-nightmare/) and the Millennial workforce stays for only half that time. A lot of employees looking to transition will start their search at the New Year making December the perfect month to focus in on retention.  
  
Here are three simple ideas you can implement this month to help set your company up for amazing employee retention in 2016:

1. **Incorporate your organizational values in to a thank you letter to your employees for their work over the past year.** For example, at WorkBright one of our core values is that "we listen". This means listening to our customers, investors, board, AND our **![](/images/blog/3-retention-ideas-try-month-december-2015/shutterstock_224216140.jpg)**employees. In review of the previous year, our founders identified that our policy on dependents with health insurance was a concern for some employees. After reviewing the concerns and weighing options, they have revised our policy and rolled it out to the team with a quick note about how they appreciate the hard work over the last year, heard the concerns, and the actions they took to overcome the issue. _(p.s. we used our internal WorkBright account for open enrollment! Find out how in the left hand column.)_ 

2. **Have managers perform a PERSONAL outreach for each individual on their team.** This can be in the form of a christmas card with a personal note or in person. At WorkBright, we attended a group dinner with our team and their significant others (see the picture below in our WorkBright Workplace section). Once wine was served, our CEO went around the table saying what he was thankful about with each employee. Not only did that give each individual the warm and fuzzies, but it was great for our signifiant others to hear as they are hugely influential in supporting each of us in our roles. 

3. **![](/images/blog/3-retention-ideas-try-month-december-2015/shutterstock_238694290.jpg)Take time out for fun.** The end of the year can be busy for most companies with budgets being set for the next year, sales closing, and wrapping up books. While it's customary for most companies to have a holiday celebration after work, consider making room for some holiday fun during normal working hours. For example, host a cookie bake off and sponsor a $100 prize. Have everyone meet to taste cookies and drink hot chocolate at a specified time in the company break room and vote on their favorite. In our office? We've got Christmas movies playing (on mute) on the big screen. It makes for some great conversation between coworkers about their favorites and a quick mid-day pause when the iconic sledding scene comes on from Christmas Vacation.
