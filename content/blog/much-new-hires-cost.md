October marks the start of budget season for companies across the country! It's the time of year where we start to take a look back at 2016 and begin making decisions about what will make the cut in 2017. However, sometimes your organization's most expensive processes may not be ones that have a formal line item on your budget... yet!
Did you know that the average cost to onboard a new employee is over $100 per new hire? Take a look below to evaluate how your onboarding process stacks up and check out our ROI calculator to see exactly how much you can save by automating onboarding through WorkBright!


**The Average Cost to Onboard A New Employee is $103!**

How did we get there? It's simple! There are 3 major factors that contribute to a company's onboarding cost:

1. **Set-up Time -** This included preparing offer letters, putting together new hire paperwork and benefits information, scanning documents, issuing background checks, filing and assisting in the completion of these forms with the new employee. The average set-up time including all these factors is 1.75 Hours

2. **Employees Time -** Many organizations pay their employees on the first day to sit in a room and fill out all their new hire paperwork. The average employee paperwork completion time is 1.5 hours

3. **Administration Time -** This includes chasing down missing information, going back and forth with the new employee on incorrect forms, entering information into an HRIS / Payroll / Other system and much more to get the employee integrated into your organization. The average administration time for each new hire is 1.4 hours.
When we take these averages and multiply by a typical HR employee's salary of $50,000 annually and the average new hire hourly wage of $12.50 per hour, we get to a blended onboarding cost of $103 per employee.  
  
**WorkBright's Onboarding Cost is Under $12!**
