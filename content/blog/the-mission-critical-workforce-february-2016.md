#### WorkBright Tips 

**Rehiring Staff and Archiving Seasons In WorkBright!** 

Did you know that you can easily rehire staff members from past seasons? By using the “Seasons” functionality in WorkBright, you can archive an entire season of employees. This article will show you a step by step for archiving an old season, starting a new one, and inviting back the employees you’d like to return.

Step 0: Double Check Your Form “Renewal Statuses”

Each form in your WorkBright account has a “renewal status” for when an employee is rehired in a new season. The three renewal status options are:




- 

None (Form is only collected once, during initial onboarding)

- 

Every year: a new submission is required each season

- 

Review and update if necessary

 

The proper renewal status will ensure that your returning employees only have to fill out what is necessary -- not everything as if they were a new hire. To double check your form renewal statuses, go to Onboarding \> Forms \> Edit Form

  ![](http://www2.workbright.com/l/81162/2016-02-04/21prkg/81162/34149/1.png)

This will take you into the details page of the form where you can change the renewal status if need be.

![](http://www2.workbright.com/l/81162/2016-02-04/21prkj/81162/34151/2.png)

NOTE: the W4, W9, and I9 do not appear in your forms list, and therefore the renewal status on these forms cannot be changed. The renewal status is automatically set to the following:

- 

W4: a new submission is required each season

- 

W9: a new submissions is required each season

- 

I9: None (only collected once during initial onboarding)

Step 1: Create a New Season

Go to Settings \> Seasons \> + New Season.

  ![](http://www2.workbright.com/l/81162/2016-02-04/21prsd/81162/34155/3.png)

This is where you’ll name your new season as well as set start and end dates and deadlines. Note that by simply creating the new season, you are NOT YET making it your current season so any deadlines or dates you set here will not yet affect anything in your WorkBright account. You can always revisit this page and make changes to dates and deadlines later. Click “submit.”

  ![](http://www2.workbright.com/l/81162/2016-02-04/21prsg/81162/34157/4.png)

Step 2: Make the New Season Your Current Season

Hover over the desired season to get an “Edit” menu as well as a dropdown arrow. The dropdown arrow will lead to the season activation button.

  ![](http://www2.workbright.com/l/81162/2016-02-04/21prsj/81162/34159/5.png)

Step 3: Go to the Staff Page to Rehire Employees That You’d Like to Return

When you go to the Staff page, it’ll now be blank because your new current season is empty. You can then use the Seasons toggle to revisit the personnel files of a prior season. Select the season you’d like to rehire staff from:

  ![](http://www2.workbright.com/l/81162/2016-02-04/21prsl/81162/34161/6.png)

Step 4: Select the Staff You’d Like to ReHire

Tick the boxes next to the names of the staff you’d like to rehire, then hit the orange “Rehire For Current Season” button.

  ![](http://www2.workbright.com/l/81162/2016-02-04/21prsx/81162/34163/7.png)

You’ll then get a screen where you can confirm season start and end dates, as well as which day you’d like to launch the “Welcome Back!” email. NOTE: If you’d like to change anything in a particular staff’s profile before you launch those emails (like giving them a bump in pay or adding them to a new group), it can be helpful to set the Welcome Email Send Date to a date sometime in the future. That will give you time to make any necessary tweaks to their profiles.

  ![](http://www2.workbright.com/l/81162/2016-02-04/21prt2/81162/34165/8.png)

An email will then go out to those staff selected inviting them to log back in and complete any new paperwork and review last year’s documents for accuracy.

## Improved User Experience For Your Mission Critical Workforce!

We love our customers! You hear us say that [all the time](https://workbright.com/3-reasons-were-thankful-for-our-customers/) but this month, we want to highlight the group of our customers that we refer to as the _ **Mission Critical Workforce**._   
  
Yes, we serve businesses that hire rapidly. Yes, we help HR administrators, hiring managers, and onboarding specialists. But what makes us really excited about what we do is developing solutions that directly address the unique needs of an otherwise underserved 27% of the American Workforce.  
  
You may refer to them as seasonal, contract, freelance, part-time, temporary, or contingent workers. We think of them as the front lines of your business. **They are there when you need them most, often times interact directly with your customers, and represent your brand making them _Mission Critical_ to the success of your business!**   
  
Over the last month we've been focusing in on small tweaks to _the employee_ experience that streamline the onboarding process to produce happier, ready-to-work employees on the first day of their mission. Below are two highlights from the work that has been done. If you want to see it in action, join us on our next group demonstration by registering here: 

**[\>\> Register For The Demonstration Here \<\<](https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/9113190348970265601)**

**​Updated Mobile Interface** **![](http://www2.workbright.com/l/81162/2016-02-02/zgfhv/81162/33879/gifofmobile.gif)**The Mission Critical Workforce is constantly on-the-go. Whether they are wrapping up their current position, moving on a short-term basis to your new position, or just in a location without good access to technology resources, the one thing that unites them is a smart phone. That's why **every form on the WorkBright platform can be viewed, filled out, and submitted via any web-enabled device.** We took a hard look at our interface this past month and reworked it to be even more user friendly!  
  
**Improved Automatic Emails** 

 **_![](http://www2.workbright.com/l/81162/2016-02-03/21c44l/81162/33999/workbright_invite_email.png)_**

We're rolling out an update to the automatic emails that are automatically sent out from our systems to include a "sign in" link instead of a copy and paste temporary password. New employees will still be given the opportunity to set their own password when they first log in but this new notification should reduce errors and increase security for the end-user.  
  
If you'd like to learn more about how WorkBright can help your Mission Critical Workforce get up and running faster, join us for a half-hour, live group demonstration on February 25th.

## Nominate A Mission Critical Workforce Member of the Month!

  
  
As we stated above, our end-users are the Mission Critical Workforce members that represent your company on the front-lines of your business when you need them most. This group of seasonal, contract, freelance, part-time, temporary, and contingent workers has often times been thought of as 'those that cannot find full-time work', but we whole-heartedly disagree!  
  
 [![Read Peter's Story Here](http://www2.workbright.com/l/81162/2016-02-03/21df2j/81162/34017/P1000134.JPG)](https://workbright.com/mcw-member-of-the-month-peter-holter/)We know this group to be adventurers, movers & shakers, never-settlers, and passion-seekers. We believe that a large portion of this workforce _ **chooses** _ a constantly shifting work-schedule that allows them to pursue many different interests throughout the year. They desire a healthy work-life balance in which they can earn cash for a portion of the year and travel another portion, or vary their responsibilities to utilize different skill sets.  
  
[![](http://www2.workbright.com/l/81162/2016-02-03/21df4j/81162/34019/peter_holter.png)](https://workbright.com/mcw-member-of-the-month-peter-holter/)Whatever the motivation, we are setting out to change the conversation about this workforce from one of circumstance to one of CHOICE! We plan to do this by [profiling one Mission Critical Workforce member](http://goo.gl/forms/PWDNUJdxph) each month. We're starting out with one of our own, our Director of Customer Success, Peter Holter. 

**[\>\>\> Check Out Peter's Feature Here \<\<\<](https://workbright.com/mcw-member-of-the-month-peter-holter/)**

If you have a Mission Critical Workforce member that embodies this spirit and works several jobs in a year to create a sustainable lifestyle, we'd love to feature them in 2016! Not only will this be a resume booster and badge of honor, but we will also give them a $100 visa gift card to reward their awesome work!

## WorkBright Workplace: Annual Strategic Retreat

  
  
[![](http://www2.workbright.com/l/81162/2016-02-03/21dfr2/81162/34033/gropu_skiing.jpg)](https://workbright.com/plan-fun-high-impact-strategic-retreat-team/)  
  
THANK YOU to all of our customers for letting us shut down businesses for two days last week for our [annual strategic retreat!](https://workbright.com/plan-fun-high-impact-strategic-retreat-team/) Our offsite meeting took us to the beautiful [Snow Mountain Ranch](http://snowmountainranch.org/) in Granby, CO for a little adventure, and a lot of revisiting of our foundational directions and strategic planning for the year ahead.  
  
**Our goals for the trip:**
- Deepen team relationships and promote open and honest communication
- Revisit and add to WorkBright foundational directions to confirm and re-commit
- Personal long term visioning
- Have fun!
... And fun we did have! (Check the left hand column for more pics from the trip.) The whole team came away from our two day's with more clarity on where we are heading and a deeper connection to each other and our customer base.  
  
If you're interested in throwing your own retreat, check out our full agenda in this How-To post we just put up on our blog and subscribe to catch all the followup posts we plan to do on each exercise we went through!
