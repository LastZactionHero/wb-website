Quality job candidates are hard to find and even harder to hire. Why is this? Could it be that your company’s hiring and recruiting processes are driving away the best job candidates?  
  
 ![shutterstock_127223492](/images/blog/driving-away-the-best-job-candidates/shutterstock_127223492-287x300.jpg)During the hiring process, it's your job to make a good first impression. Do your absolute best to convince every job candidate that your company is the best option. Sell the job and the company at every step of the hiring process. One bad impression during this delicate time and you could scare the perfect job candidate away – and that’s unacceptable.

#### 

#### Here are 9 common ways that your company is driving away the best job candidates:


1. **Impersonal Communication** - Behind every application is a real person. Be a human being. Show them that you care and that you value their time by personalizing the experience.

2. **Difficult Application Process** - Many job seekers will not complete a difficult or time-consuming application. Use a simple application to capture the important info. You can focus on details later.

3. **Misuse Of Applicant Tracking Systems** - ATS systems tend to eliminate way too many good candidates. By only focusing on specific keywords or experience, you'll miss out on some of the best job applicants.

4. **Out-Of-Date Recruiting Methods** - Modern job seekers expect modern hiring processes. You need to be online, using email, and taking advantage of technology. Job seekers expect this.

5. **Beautifully Vague Job Descriptions** – Write honest and detailed job descriptions that paint a picture of the job's role, responsibilities, and day-to-day activities. Let the candidate know what they are getting in to.

6. **Lack Of Job Interview Prep** - Be prepared for the job interview. Show the candidate that you respect and value their time.

7. **No Web Presence** - Candidates will Google your company. They want to see positive company reviews, employees on social media, exciting company culture and brand, and more.

8. **Too Focused On The Perfect Employee** - When HR only wants to hire the perfect employee, they unintentionally alienate other job seekers. Be open and responsive to anyone who is qualified for the job.

9. **Uncompetitive Job Offer** – Offer a competitive employment package. If you don’t, the best candidates will happily go and work for your competitor.

Take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Put yourself in the job seeker’s shoes. Go through the hiring process from their point of view. You may notice that your company's current hiring techniques and recruitment strategies are actually driving away the best job candidates.  
  
Luckily, the hiring process is completely in your hands. A few simple tweaks to the way that you hire can ultimately get the results you’ve been hoping for.
