WorkBright Tips

  
  

**Resending a Welcome Email to a New Hire**

With summer hiring in full swing, we wanted to detail out how to resend your welcome email to a new hire who claims they lost it or never received it. Humble brag: our delivery rates are AMAZING so we're going to show you how to check it went to the right place.  
  
1. First, **double check their email address on the overview tab of their Personnel File.** On occasion, you may have misentered their email address, and that would be the cause for the new hire not receiving the invite. Double check that the email address in WorkBright is the same as the one they’ve been communicating with you from. If it isn’t you can edit it easily:

2. Once you’ve ensured the email address is correct, you can **resend the invite on the employment tab** of their Personnel File.

## WorkBright Workplace: Do You Know Your HR Vocabulary? 

  
  
The world of HR is changing at a rapid pace.

Below are our first 3 blog posts on new HR terms that, if you haven't already heard, you will in the near future.
