Does your company have an employee handbook? Every business needs to create a detailed, comprehensive, and up-to-date employee handbook and provide it to their team. It is an essential communication tool that will help your business run smoothly.  
  
The employee handbook should be included as a part of the HR paperwork that every employee is given during the onboarding process. We recommend making new employees sign the employee handbook to ensure every single employee has seen, read, and understood this document before they are officially hired. By clearly and concisely outlining a standardized set of rules, regulations, and guidelines for the work environment, your entire team will be on the same page and have the same expectations.

Your employee handbook needs to be simple and easy to understand in order to protect both the rights of the employee and to decrease the legal risk of an employer. Not only is the handbook a resource that everyone can turn to, it is also an all-encompassing document that applies the same standards to one and all.

#### Besides just creating a fair work environment, there are many other reasons why your company needs an employee handbook, including:

- Complying with any and all federal and state laws
- Defining company's mission, vision, and culture
- Communicating guidelines and expectations
- Highlighting compensation and benefits
- Outlining company policies, procedures, and rules
- Protecting both employees and employers

Ideally the employee handbook will cover all of the necessary and pertinent information that an employee needs to know about working at your company from start to finish. Upper management and legal teams need to work together to decide exactly what content to include as this document must be customized for your specific business.
#### The topics covered in an employee handbook will vary depending on your business and your industry. Topics may include:

- Mission, Vision, & Culture
- Policies and Procedures
- Rules and Regulations
- Standards of Conduct
- Non-Disclosure Agreements
- Compensation - Pay & Benefits
- Performance Reviews
- Drug and Alcohol Policies
- Disciplinary Actions
- Job Roles
- Training Opportunities
- Termination Procedures
- Technology Policies
- Anti-Discrimination Policies
- Scheduling Matters
- Appearance and Dress Codes
- Sick Policies
- Safety and Security
By providing clear and concise information about your company, employees should always know what to expect in the workplace. There won't be any surprises. This is a good thing as it can boost employee retention rates, motivate workers, and increase employee satisfaction - all things that will help your business become more successful.  
  
It's your responsibility to ensure that every employee reads and signs that they've received and understand your employee handbook. Issue an updated copy to your full-time staff on a regular basis and give your seasonal employees a new copy every time they are re-hired.  
  
Since an employee handbook could potentially have legal implications, it’s imperative that you work with your legal team to write an employee handbook that protects all parties involved. The employee handbook is an important document for your company’s long-term success.
