How long do I9 files have to be kept? Do I need to destroy them after a certain amount of years?  
  
**In A Nutshell:** Keep them for 3 years from hire date or 1 year from termination.  
  
**More Explanation:** I9 requirements include employers keeping I9's for 3 years from date of hire or 1 year from termination, whichever is greater. We always make the recommendation to clients that they keep an I9 calendar to track compliance related to initial (3 day) completion, reverification/work authorization expiration, and document retention. [Tip: Or let [WorkBright](https://workbright.com)do the compliance piece for you!]

Regarding document retention, the only rule is related to how long you keep the docs - not what you do after you've met that requirement. Companies should make sure they dispose of I9s properly (keeping an eye on privacy and security since they contain _extremely sensitive_ info) and in compliance with a document retention policy - if they have one. You don't want the DOL to audit and try to fine you for 200 incorrect I9s that should have been tossed years ago.
