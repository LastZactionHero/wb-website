Writing an effective job ad is the first major step in the hiring process. It’s easy to write a basic job ad and post it online in a matter of minutes, but in order to attract top talent you need to spend time crafting an effective job ad that gets the results you are looking for.  
  
There is no recipe or formula for a perfect job ad, but it's a good idea to use the AIDA model. AIDA stands for Attention, Interest, Desire, Action. It’s your job to grab the job seeker’s attention, pique their interest, appeal to their employment desires, and drive them to apply. Don’t worry. It’s not as hard as you might think.
#### To write an effective job ad you need to include the following elements:


1. **Intriguing Job Title** - Choose a catchy job title that encourages the job seeker to read your entire job ad.

2. **Introduction** – Briefly introduce the job opening. Personalize the job ad by asking questions like, "Do you want to work for a company that will change the world?" or "Are you keen to join an award winning team?" Engage the job seeker and capture their attention.

3. **Description Of Ideal Candidate** - Define the required and preferred qualifications, skills, traits, experience, and certifications that job candidates must possess. Be specific.

4. **Job Details** - Describe the job. Give the job seeker a glimpse into a day in the life of this role. Mention the team, hours, goals, responsibilities, and other pertinent info.

5. **Location** – Today’s job ads attract a global audience. Tell job seekers exactly where the job is located and mention if work visas can be supplied. Highlight if remote work or telecommuting is an option.

6. **Company Information** – Provide a quick snapshot of your company. Tell job seekers what your business is all about. Create a highlight reel of the company's accomplishments, team, awards, products/services, culture, and brand.

7. **Salary & Benefits** - Be up front and honest about pay and benefits. Job seekers want to know this info sooner than later.

8. **Contact Details** – Let job seekers know how to contact you. Include website, phone, and email. List a contact person for more details.

9. **Directions** - Tell the job seeker what to do after they apply. This is a test to see if they can follow directions, but also provides guidelines on what to expect next.

10. **Videos & Photos** - Videos and photos bring your job ad to life. Always include media to enhance the job seeker’s experience.
