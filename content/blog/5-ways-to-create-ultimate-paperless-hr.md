---
Many years after the advent of computers, the paperless HR department still remains an elusive goal to many managers. And who could blame them? HR is a department teeming with processes, procedures, and all sorts of legal requirements - most of which are very much paper-based. To go paperless, HR managers have to consider all sorts of security, accuracy, accessibility, and compliance issues.  
  
Good thing paperless technology has gone a long way from simply digitizing files through scanners. Reliable mobile onboarding technologies are available to solve lingering issues and speed up recruitment processes with undisputable cost and environmental benefits.  
  
Paperless technology was one of the biggest trends in the HR world in 2014, and it’s not showing any signs of slowing down. And what’s not to love? Having the right mobile onboarding technology in place that can digitally capture, manage, and protect critical HR data has a huge impact on everyone’s productivity.  
  
But while the paperless trend is gaining traction, there’s still much to achieve. Globally, just about 24 percent of organizations are working towards going paperless. If you’re a company owner contemplating on this big move but are quite daunted by the enormous tasks ahead, here are a few simple and practical steps to help you get started.  
  
**1. Implement environment-friendly systems that encourage less paper usage.** The average employee uses up to 45 sheets of paper everyday. Document printing takes up about 10 percent of IT costs in most organizations. And then there are document storage and disposal costs, along with postage and courier expenses (if they need to be shipped). Reducing paper use does not only save on costs and space, there are also massive gains in efficiency. These can be achieved by harnessing the power of the cloud. Transitioning to cloud allows employees to create and access existing documents anytime, anywhere with any device. ROI on paperless technology such as cloud services often takes 18 months or less, according to AIIM.org.  
  
**2. Embrace digital signatures.** As an HR professional, we are all too familiar with the enormous amount of documents that need signatures. Employments contracts, performance appraisals, timesheets, checks, and on-boarding are just some that are typically signed the traditional paper-and-ink way.But the thing is, print and ink signatures take time and even delays. On average, traditional signatures take about 3 days to process. In a paperless environment, digital signatures just take a few hours to accomplish, depending how fast an employee checks email. More importantly, digital signatures are secure and compliant with regulations in most industries.  
  
**3. Do away with printers and faxes.** Printed documents and faxes are expensive and inconvenient. All those printed documents need to be properly organized or stored, or you’ll never find what you’re looking for. You can’t access them when you’re not in the office; and you have to make multiple copies if you want some back up.The problem with most HR departments is that most employees are habitual paper consumers. Cultural resistance is one of the biggest stumbling blocks in establishing a paperless office. As an HR manager, and given the huge benefits of going paperless, isn’t it about time to challenge this thinking?  
  
**4. Educate employees on the benefits of going green.**  
  
The global environmental awareness movement has gained so much ground that going paperless in business processes will eventually be a requirement, not just an option towards corporate responsibility and sustainability. Many multinational companies have taken the lead in implementing greener business practices and it won’t be long before everyone follows suit. Educating your own employees on the benefits of going green and keeping up with global trends will help in easier adoption of paperless technology. HR studies also suggest that going green can even help with recruitment and employee engagement, as many in-demand candidates and high achieving employees are passionate about environmental causes.  
  
**Putting up systems for paperless HR**  
  
To fully implement these paperless office measures, proper support infrastructures should be put in place. Mobile HR onboarding, for instance, addresses most of the steps above by automating tedious work flows and virtually all costs related to hiring paperwork.  
  
If you are a business that needs to onboard new employees fast, you know the administrative overheads can be very overwhelming. An effective mobile HR onboarding system drastically reduces the time it takes to collect and process form for these new hires.  
  
**A great mobile onboarding software allows:**
- Employees to access the system using any device
- HR managers to review forms instantly, eliminating piles of paperwork that has come to be staples on desks.
- Enable employees to securely submit documents such as certifications or licenses
- Allows employees to sign forms digitally, using their fingertips
