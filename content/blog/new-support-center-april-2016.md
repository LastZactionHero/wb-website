WorkBright Tips

  
  

**Using Reports to Create a Mailing List!**

While you cannot send a mass email directly from WorkBright, you CAN use WorkBright’s Reports tool to create a list of just the staff you’d like to message. Here’s a how-to example.

1. Go to Reports \> Add a New Report  
  
 ![](http://www2.workbright.com/l/81162/2016-04-07/2d2dgc/81162/41282/AR1.png)  
  
_Let’s say we’d like to message all employees who drive company vehicles whose driver’s licenses are expiring before the end of the summer. We’d like to remind them to get their licenses renewed._   
  
<u>The only field you’ll want is email</u>. That’s going to make the copy/paste into my email easier later.  
  
 ![](http://www2.workbright.com/l/81162/2016-04-07/2d2dgt/81162/41284/AR2.png)  
  
2. Next, let’s add filters to get down to JUST the people we want to message. For an example, we can ask the report to filter down to just the group that drives company vehicles, and then just those people whose licenses will expire before September 1.  
  
 ![](http://www2.workbright.com/l/81162/2016-04-07/2d2dgy/81162/41286/AR3.png)  
  
3. Run the report. This will yield a list of just email addresses, which I can then click “Copy”

4. Easily paste into a new email!

## WorkBright's New Support Center 

**_Articles, Frequently Asked Questions, How-To's and Much More!_[\>\> Click Here to Check it Out \<\<](https://workbright.desk.com/)**
As we continue to grow, we are committed to maintaining our high level of customer service that sets us apart from big-box HR technology providers.  
  
 ![](http://www2.workbright.com/l/81162/2016-04-06/2cbgvy/81162/41170/Jocelyn_Martinez.jpg)Jocelyn from Boulder Housing Partners said, _“We’re very happy with the system, but the thing that makes WorkBright stand out is the outstanding customer service! The people I work with are genuinely invested in customer success which is in stark contrast to where we were before. I believe it was over the holidays this past year that I contacted Peter, the Director of Customer Success, he was teaching ski school and responded from the slopes which is above and beyond what I would ever expect!”_  
  
To help us achieve this, we've been secretly building out [our new knowledgebase](https://workbright.desk.com/) with frequently asked questions, account setup information, how-to's, and much more!   
  
 ![](http://www2.workbright.com/l/81162/2016-04-06/2cbgt5/81162/41164/Screen_Shot_2016_04_06_at_10.27.27_AM.png)
  
  
In the new knowledgebase you can easily find articles by entering search terms or browsing topics. If you don't find what you're looking for, use the Contact links to post a public question, email, or call us!  
  
We cherish the personal relationships we've built with our customers and trust that this new support center will be an extension of resources for quick questions and reference material.
