The All4Staff team is pleased to announce that we are changing our name to WorkBright on July 1st, 2015! This decision comes after months of deliberation, requests for submissions, feedback from peers, and surveying; and we are very thankful to everyone that helped us arrive at a Company name that effectively portrays our brand promise:  
  
[![workbright](/images/blog/get-ready-to-workbright/WorkBright-W-Top-225pxHR.png)](http://workbright.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/WorkBright-W-Top-225pxHR.png)“To empower companies to be great employers by equipping them with HR technology that makes life easier and employees happier.”  
  
So why WorkBright?  
  
Besides the obvious “is that for, four or 4 in your URL?” conversations we were having weekly with the old name, we had been debating how to best deliver on our brand promise. Through these conversations - both internally and with HR practitioners across the country - it is clear that to “ **make life easier and employees happier** ” we can’t simply take existing HR processes and replicate them on an online platform. What we have done with our Onboarding product, and plan to do with all future development, is take a hard look at what is common place today and identify inefficiencies, distractions, confusion, security threats, and tedious tasks to create innovative **best practices** that fit a 21st century workplace with a younger, more tech-savvy workforce.  
  
All4Staff implies we are going to help with all the staff related activities of an HR professional’s job. But that didn’t start to capture the inspiration, fun and efficiency that we envision… we want to make you WORK BRIGHT in every step as an HR pro, or as an employee. Our first step was to bring WORK BRIGHT to the onboarding process. We’ve succeeded in adding a smile to HR pro’s by dramatically cutting the time that they spend on administration, so that they can focus on interacting with employees. And our surveys show that we have added happiness to new employees, buy giving them a painless, fast and fun first experience with their new company.  
  
Moving forward, we promise to take this same, tireless look at each HR procedure to see how technology can be used to improve or eliminate them so that you can Work Bright.  
  
WorkBright- helping companies be great employers with tech that makes life easier and employees happier.
