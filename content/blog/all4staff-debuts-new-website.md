Boulder, Colorado, April 10, 2015. All4Staff is pleased to announce the launch of its new, fully-featured website, [www.workbright.wpengine.com](http://www.workbright.wpengine.com). The site has an all-new design with enhanced mobile responsiveness features.  
  
All4Staff’s website is designed to provide HR managers a more comprehensive information on how a mobile HR onboarding solution can streamline the hiring process. All4staff aims to serve the needs of businesses who rely on seasonal or part time workforce as such those in the hospitality, camping, ramping, retail, call center, recreation, and transportation industries.  
  
All4Staff recognizes the tremendous administrative overhead that these underserved industries experience. As such, they’ve created a cloud-based HR solution for companies with contingent, seasonal, or high turnover workforces. This solution drastically reduces the time it takes to gather and process forms by automating tedious workflows and data entry. It transforms the traditional and paper-centric onboarding process to one that a new employee can complete using any device before his first day of work. This results are amazing! Studies show that at least 5x cost savings can be achieved by eliminating virtually all costs associated with new hire paperwork process.  
  
All4Staff’s new website was created in partnership with [Xtendly](http://www.xtendly.com), one of the fastest growing digital marketing firms offering a single sourced solution for web design and development, online marketing, cloud based automation, and CRM software.
