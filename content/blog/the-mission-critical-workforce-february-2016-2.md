#### WorkBright Tips 

**Have Simple Forms Skip the Review Inbox!**

For some forms, it’s ideal that HR review each form as its submitted for accuracy and completion -- forms like the I9, W4, and others can be easily misinterpreted by new employees and may need to be sent back to be recompleted. Others -- like simple signature forms -- leave very little to be reviewed. You can have those forms bypass the review inbox easily. Here’s how:





Go to Onboarding \> Forms:

Get to your list of custom forms. Within each form, you’ll need to access the “Edit Form” page:





![](/images/blog/the-mission-critical-workforce-february-2016-2/1.png)





Within each form’s “Edit Form” page, there’s a checkbox that’s already checked saying, “All submissions for this form MUST be reviewed in the inbox.”





![](/images/blog/the-mission-critical-workforce-february-2016-2/2.png)

Uncheck it. You’re done! All submissions for this form will now be automatically approved and filed without your review.





**NOTE:** The W4, W9, and I9 do not show up in your list of custom forms and therefore you will not have this opportunity to have them bypass the inbox. Those forms will always show in the inbox for your review.

## Customer Feature: Boulder Housing Partners

**_How WorkBright Affected New Hire Onboarding & Open Enrollment at BHP!_**

  
  
 ![](/images/blog/the-mission-critical-workforce-february-2016-2/BHP_Logo.jpg)The Boulder Housing Partners HR team was juggling multiple process before deciding to streamline their 50-page new hire paperwork packet into one system that could handle it all.  
  
After choosing to implement WorkBright for both their new hire paperwork and their open enrollment process, they have gained back training time, eliminated a full days work surrounding open enrollment and received overwhelmingly positive responses from new employees!

 _![](/images/blog/the-mission-critical-workforce-february-2016-2/Jocelyn_Martinez.jpg)“We were up and running in under 5 days and the feedback ever since then has been overwhelmingly positive. Not only are the forms completely automated, but workflows like I9 Countersignature are built in and our new employees (and our HR team) really love the automated email reminders that notify staff of what needs to be completed and when!” - Jocelyn Martinez_
