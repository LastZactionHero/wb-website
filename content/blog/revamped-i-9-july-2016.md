## See the Completely REVAMPED I-9! 

**[\>\> Join the Webinar to See it in Action \<\<](https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/779673966780307970)**
With more than 69 pages of rules and regulations and fines beginning at $110, the I-9 is always a hot-topic. We listened to your concerns and spent hours pouring over the [M-274 Handbook for Employers](https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/files/form/m-274.pdf) and consulting with our HR advisory team to completely revamp our I-9 into the most user-friendly, intuitive, and compliant, digital I-9 available!  
  
 ![](http://www2.workbright.com/l/81162/2016-07-14/2yhdxh/81162/54206/Employer_Review ___Screen_4___ Edit_Document_Image_and_or_Info_if_Necessary_copy.png) [Register to join us next Wednesday (7/20) at 1pm PT](https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/779673966780307970)for a first look at how our new I-9 reduces errors, streamlines processes like counter-signature and photo upload, and helps ensure compliance in your HR files. We'll also give you a look from the employee's side so you can see how easy it is for your new hires to fill out this otherwise complicated form.
