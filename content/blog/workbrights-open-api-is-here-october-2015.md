#### WorkBright Tips
**Use internal form fields to make notes on employee documents!**   
  
Did you know that the "internal" setting is NOT just for the form itself, but can be set on fields as well?! We've seen some awesome uses for this functionality and want to make sure all of our customers are taking advantage of our internal fields.  
  
For example, one of our customers that uses WorkBright to store employee reviews uses internal fields to make comments on the employees self-review worksheet to review during the one-on-one meeting. This way, the employees feedback AND the managers notes live in the same place, on the same form, without giving full visibility into the candid comments for management eyes only.  
  
Another customer is using internal fields for new employee references. They have the new hire fill out a document with three references as the final stage of application, then use internal fields to make notes on the reference call so all data is on one form.

## WorkBright's Open API is here!

At WorkBright, we are all about streamlining your process and making your life easier. So when we sat down to take a hard look at how we could make the flow of information in and out of our system even better, we decided a seamless integration to share information with your other HR systems was the only way to go so we created an open API! 

**_What's an API?_**

  
  
 ![API (/images/blog/workbrights-open-api-is-here-october-2015/Application Program Interface) is the connection that makes it possible for two programs to interact with each other.](http://www2.workbright.com/l/81162/2015-10-07/byznw/81162/21164/shutterstock_294412070.jpg)_An API (/images/blog/workbrights-open-api-is-here-october-2015/Application Program Interface) is the connection that makes it possible for two programs to exchange certain pieces of information while keeping the rest of the system(s) safe and secure._   
  
Now, enterprise customers can work with their technical teams to configure our API with their existing systems (like ATS, ERP, or any other system that stores employee data) to keep employee records up-to-date and synchronized like they were one database. Additionally, customers with large recruiting operations (e.g. staffing, on-demand workforces, etc.) can programmatically 'push' employee data INTO WorkBright from an ATS - eliminating the need for any kind of manual data entry or CSV import/export.   
  
**Use the WorkBright API to:**  
  

- Keep systems in sync
- Create custom workflows
- Bring employees into WorkBright from your ATS
- Integrate onboarding in to native applications
- Build on top of WorkBright to achieve business results
- Much, Much More! 

[**\>\>\> CUSTOMERS: Contact Us About Our API Here \<\<\<**](https://workbright.com/contact/)

If you don't have WorkBright yet, but are interested in using WorkBright with your ATS, payroll, or other HR systems, [contact us here](https://workbright.com/request-a-demo/) to request a demonstration!

## WorkBright Workplace: Our New Office Space

If you saw our feature on Cary Yocum last month, then you know that our team is GROWING. And with this growth comes some business necessities... like a place to put everyone! So we have moved our operations in to a private workspace in our home office at 1035 Pearl St. in Boulder, Colorado. _No need to update your address book, it's the same address as before for billing and operations purposes._ 
As a **thank you** to our customers - new and old - that have made this possible, we wanted to share a few photos from our new space. If you're ever in town, give us a ring and come say hello - our view is Incredible!
