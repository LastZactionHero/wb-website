Every year [Entrepreneur](http://www.entrepreneur.com/) selects [100 Brilliant Companies to Watch](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/245890) that, in the Magazine's own words, "have a couple of qualities in common: They inspire us, and they are driving change."  
  
We are thrilled to announce that [WorkBright](https://workbright.com) (formerly All4Staff) **has the honor of being included on this year's 100 Brilliant Companies** in the ["Brilliant Business Tools"](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/245907) category!  
  
We are especially excited about our inclusion on this list because of the criteria that Entrepreneur used to evaluate it's finalists, _"... That's the picture of entrepreneurship today. It's a picture we try to illustrate through our selection of 100 brilliant companies, ideas and technologies that are responding to consumer demand, solving problems and filling voids we might not have even realized were there."_  
  
If you've read [our story](http://workbright.wpengine.com/company/), then you know that that's exactly what we are trying to do... change the way that HR directors, managers, and hiring agents think about onboarding by bringing HR processes in to the 21st century to make them easier, more efficient, and more secure.
