#### WorkBright Tips
**Use custom profile fields to collect additional data on your employees!**   
  
Do you have information you need about your new hires but it doesn't actually require a form? You can capture this profile information using custom profile fields in your WorkBright settings area! Get creative with information you would want. For example, camps and restaurants may want t-shirt or uniform size. Technical roles may wan to have programmers check off coding languages they can write in. Customer support roles may want to capture other languages spoken. Anything you would want to collect to build out a profile of your staff can be worked in to your WorkBright system!  
  
**Want help setting this up?** Contact our support team at [support@workbright.com](mailto:support@workbright.com)

## Introducing _Robust_ Reporting!

We've always allowed WorkBright users to export data for payroll but we noticed that a lot our customers were using this functionality to export other valuable information as well - like staff contact information and employee status. So we spent the last month expanding our reporting functionality to include filtering and exporting of ANY data collected on your employees in WorkBright!

[**\>\>\> Check Out More Details Here \<\<\<**](https://workbright.desk.com/customer/portal/articles/2093234-creating-a-report)
 ![](/images/blog/introducing-robust-reporting-september-2015/new_report.png)  
  

As we continually strive to be your one stop shop for all employee related information, we are so excited about the possibilities this new functionality presents as your digital employee filing cabinet. Imagine the possibilities of being able to quickly and accurately export:
- **Staff Directory -** No more forgetting to remove and add employees. Simply set up and save your directory with Name, Title, Email, Phone, etc. one time, then run and distribute on the first of each month so the whole organization always has the latest information on only active employees. 
- **Expiration Dates -** At the beginning of each quarter set up a saved report with the expiration date of CPR cards, drivers licenses and any pivotal certification so you can proactively alert employees to update their information and keep compliance issues at bay. 
- **Statistics on Your Employee Base -** Getting ready to hire and want to know the average salary on any given team? Easily export pay rates in any group for comparison. Want to target your new hire ads to a more accurate group? Export the age and locale of your current employee base to find your current staff's exact demographic. 
To help current users learn how to use our new 'Reports' tab, we put together [this knowledgebase article](https://workbright.desk.com/customer/portal/articles/2093234-creating-a-report). If you're not a current user but would like to see this new functionality in action, [contact us here](https://workbright.com/request-a-demo/) to request a demonstration!

## HR Vocabulary: Inboarding

  
  
Hiring is a major endeavor with the traditional cost of simply onboarding a new employee measuring over $103. HR managers across the country are beginning to realize how crucial it is keep your best employees through engagement and planning — thus a new HR term has been born – Inboarding.  
  
**Definition:** “Inboarding” is the term that’s being used for the steps that can be taken to retain good employees. It doesn’t involve anything complicated, and most of the things we recommend fall under “good management,” if not plain old common sense.  
  
[![career ladder](/images/blog/introducing-robust-reporting-september-2015/career-ladder.jpg)](/images/blog/introducing-robust-reporting-september-2015/career-ladder.jpg) **Why it matters:** The process of recruiting talent is a significant expense for businesses. Every time someone leaves, that expense is incurred all over again. Not to mention you’ve lost part of your team, which affects productivity.  
  
But why should anyone stay with you when they can get a nice raise by changing companies? Inboarding makes it feasible for talented individuals to stay on, rather than looking elsewhere to get what they want from their jobs. Having a documented inboarding plan for good employees can save your organization thousands over the next few years and makes employees feel more engaged and committed to your organization.  
  
Are you inboarding your best employees? For three actionable tips to get you started on an inboarding plan, [visit our blog!](https://workbright.com/hr-vocabulary-inboarding/)
