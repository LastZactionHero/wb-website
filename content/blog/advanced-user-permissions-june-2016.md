WorkBright Tips

  
  

**Bring Your Dashboard Up to Speed**

Does your dashboard show that a much smaller number of your staff are “totally done” than you think it should based on your overall employee count?  
  
Looking something like this...

![](/images/blog/advanced-user-permissions-june-2016/TT1.PNG)

In the example above, if only 90 have incomplete required forms, that means that 299 staff have done everything they can, so why does it only say 28 are finished? This is because you, the administrator, haven’t finished their “internal forms” -- typically things like uploading background check results or references.

To bring your dashboard up to speed, you just need to knock out those internal forms. Since it’s often 1 or 2 of the same forms for every employee, here’s the quickest route -- go to the Onboarding Tab \> Forms, then click on the name of the form to access a mini-dashboard devoted to just that form.

![](/images/blog/advanced-user-permissions-june-2016/TT2.PNG)

Hover over a person’s name to make a “More button” appear to the right, which will include an “Upload” option.

That will take you into a screen where you have an upload option:

WorkBright will accept images or PDFs. Select the file you want to upload from your computer and upload.

## Introducing Advanced User Permissions! 

**[\>\> Join the Webinar to See it in Action \<\<](https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/6485975486885835266)**
When WorkBright sets out to solve a major HR issue like access control to personal employee information, we go ALL IN! For the past 6 months our team has been thinking through every user permission issue, meeting with leading HR experts, studying the legal implications of access, and building out one of the most advanced user permission feature sets available in HR technology!   
  
 ![](/images/blog/advanced-user-permissions-june-2016/User_Permissions.PNG)Finally, on June 22nd, we are ready to release this new functionality **FOR FREE** to all of our existing customers and any new customers that start Working Bright in the month of June! Check out the details below and[join our Director of Customer Success on 6/22 at 10am PT to see it for yourself.](https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/6485975486885835266)   
  
**User Permissions FAQ:**  
  
**What can I restrict with User Permissions?** As always, employees only have access to their own files which you designate. This new functionality allows super tight controls for individual administrators working within your system... and you can restrict pretty darn near anything now including:
- Editing or viewing different groups
- Viewing social security numbers or birthdays on any forms
- Viewing & editing specific details of profile information 
- Allowing or denying editing of forms 
- Viewing submissions of certain completed forms (like I9) 
- Allowing access to approve, reject, countersign, and perform other actions
- Custom permission options for individual managers & administrators
- Much, Much More! 
**Who does User Permissions most benefit?** **![](/images/blog/advanced-user-permissions-june-2016/UP2.PNG)**User permissions is primarily beneficial for larger HR teams or HR teams that distribute part of the paperwork process to managers and team leads. However, you can never be too careful when it comes to protecting your employee's personal information so we think this is a huge win for all WorkBright users and HR departments looking to go paperless!  
  
**How do I get User Permissions turned on for my account?** First things first, we are thrilled to offer user permissions 100% free to any new or existing clients who are <u>signed up before July 1st</u>. Since this new feature set is so advanced, we will be offering it by request only and are requiring clients to attend our live training event or view the recording before we flip the switch to allow user permissions on your account.  
  
**Ready to get started?** [Join our live webinar](https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/6485975486885835266) June 22nd at 10am PT which will be geared towards current customers. If you're just checking out WorkBright and want to learn more, you can join our new feature learning session, or [join us for our next group demo, here](https://workbright.com/group-demo/).

## WorkBright Workplace: Meet Kelcie Bynum

  
  
 ![](/images/blog/advanced-user-permissions-june-2016/profile.jpg)One of the things we are most proud of at WorkBright is our quick implementation time and outstanding customer support. Kelcie Bynum is a key piece to this puzzle and if you've come on with WorkBright in the past 6 months, there's a good chance she was the one setting up your forms - sometimes in less than 4 DAYS!  
  
Since Kelcie is emerging as a WorkBright rockstar and starting to work directly with many of you throughout your time with WorkBright, we thought it would be nice for you to get to know her on a more personal level. Maybe next time you connect you can ask her about, Kansas, Washington, Oregon or her other travels mentioned in this interview!  
  
**Where are you from?** Wichita, KS  
  
**What drew you to come work at WorkBright?** The team is what initially drew me to WorkBright. I enjoy working with people who are hardworking and team oriented. When I began working at WB a co-worker had just had his first child and the other members of the team were very quick to jump in and take on his responsibilities of further interviewing and training me so that he could have more time to spend taking care of his wife and newborn. This impressed me because it’s not something you see in a lot of other workplaces.  
  
**What is your favorite thing about working at WorkBright?** Getting to know our customers and conversing with many different people from all over the country is what I enjoy most about working at WorkBright. Also, being able to work on my own time and having a flexible schedule is a big plus. I have a variety of interests and I benefit from having a position that complements my current lifestyle. Now, I can enjoy teaching yoga, crafting, spending time with my daughter, and working for a great company.  
  
**What motivates you?** My family, specifically my four year old daughter.  
  
**What is your favorite vacation spot?** I resided in Washington state for a few years, so I am a bit biased, but I love the Pacific Northwest. I find Oregon particularly beautiful. I love to be by the mountains and enjoy hiking.  
  
**If you had a superpower what would it be?** I would like to be able to fly, so I could travel to meet all of our new customers in person!
