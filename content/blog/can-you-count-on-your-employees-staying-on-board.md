It’s well known that employees don’t stay with one company for decades like they used to, and recent reports have stated that a large part of the workforce is disengaged—but would you have guessed that up to 42% of your very satisfied workers are seriously considering leaving their jobs?

That’s quite eye-opening for HR specialists, and emphasizes the need to know your workforce, and to be prepared for change.  
  
It’s also interesting that over 60% of those who said they “feel a strong sense of commitment to my organization” and “would recommend my organization to others as a good place to work” said _they are considering leaving._ If you’re interested in seeing more statistics from the report, the results are summarized in an infographic by [clicking here](http://www.mercer.us/insights/focus/inside-employees-minds-the-transforming-employment-experience/infographic.html).  
  
**Millenials Are Changing the Way Employment Works**  
  
A large part of the reason for happily employed workers to move on is that Millenials tend to value workplace culture, accelerated career paths, and a variety of experiences over job security. Millenials are, overall, the most positive group when it comes to how they view their jobs, so the ready pace at which they change jobs doesn’t relate to being disenchanted or feeling unappreciated. It would seem that greener pastures are very alluring to these folks, and there’s little fear of finding out that things are much the same on the other side, once the fence is jumped.  
  
**The Takeaway for HR Departments**  
  
It’s important to be aware of employment trends, and to know that if your highly qualified young people tell you they are satisfied, but leave anyway, it isn’t necessarily a reflection on your company or its management. On the other hand, job diversity, mentoring, and functioning as a socially conscious business are all things that have become important for retaining young professionals. HR specialists should be vigilant about looking for ways to improve in those areas.

[**For WorkBright Users**](http://www.workbright.com)  
  
Have you ever considered running a [NPS test for your employees](http://www.netpromotersystem.com/about/employee-engagement.aspx)? Studies have shown that NPS for employees is a great way to track engagement over time and can actually correlate to your externally facing NPS scores. You can then track those NPS scores in an employee's WorkBright account and track them over time to see if their engagement is increasing or decreasing. For help setting this up contact [support@workbright.com](mailto:support@workbright.com).
