#### WorkBright Tips

**Sort tables by clicking the Column Header!** 
 ![](/images/blog/behind-the-scenes-of-your-account-october-2015/Column_Sorting.png)

Did you know that you can sort almost any table in our app by clicking on the Column Header? An arrow will appear if sorting in ascending or descending order.

**Try using sorting for:**   
  
Required Forms on the staff page to _ **see who is lagging behind** _ the most. Pending how close you are to their potential start date, assign a team member to make phone calls to those employees.  
  
_ **Birthday reports** _ so you can see whose big day is coming up next and plan accordingly.  
  
Custom data like _ **uniform size** _ then sort by size to count up how many larges, mediums, and smalls.  
  
_ **Hire start dates** _ so you see who is up for their annual review this month and congratulate them on their work anniversary.  
  
**Want help sorting or running reports like these?** Contact our support team at [support@workbright.com](mailto:support@workbright.com)

## October Wrap Up_Behind the Scenes of Your Account_

October was a super busy month at our WorkBright headquarters! On top of the release of our new API, our developers focused in on a lot of 'little things' that have been requested, imagined, and dreamt about by our team and customers. A lot of this work was happening behind the scenes meaning you may or may not have noticed. Either way, we are super proud of our team for all their work and want to make sure you know about the great new updates in your account. So with that, we bring you the "October Wrap Up"! Check out the updates below and email us at [support@workbright.com](mailto:support@workbright.com) if you have any questions about this new functionality. 

**Increased Performance on Staff Page** The load time on the staff page got it's first round of TLC increasing the performance time by 3.2x ![](/images/blog/behind-the-scenes-of-your-account-october-2015/Screen_Shot_2015_11_02_at_11.31.41_AM.png) **International Address Fields** New staff members can now manually enter a region or province if entering a non-US country in to the address fields **![](/images/blog/behind-the-scenes-of-your-account-october-2015/Screen_Shot_2015_11_02_at_4.37.05_PM.png)Reports Filtering on Custom Form Fields**The reports functionality has been upgraded to be able to pull and filter custom form data in the new reports tab  
  
**MM/DD Birthday Field Format Added** To better support government and third-party forms that ask for birthday as just Month and Day, we added this form field type which pulls just that information out of the employee profile  
  
**Made Phone a Numeric-Only Output Format** To make the transfer of your data to Payroll even easier, we made the employees phone number a numeric-only output  
  
**Updated Administrator Page Display ![](/images/blog/behind-the-scenes-of-your-account-october-2015/Screen_Shot_2015_11_02_at_4.35.05_PM.png)**We are now displaying email addresses on the Admin page so you can easily see what email is tied to each administrator  
  
**Kiosk Mode Displays Only Active Staff** Now, only the ACTIVE staff will display for customers utilizing kiosk mode to allow employees to fill out paperwork on location
