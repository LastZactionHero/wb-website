When businesses make big changes, there are bound to be challenges for HR. When a company with 300,000 employees splits into two separate corporations, it could be an HR catastrophe—but not if Human Resource Executive’s HR Executive of the Year is heading things up.

She pulled it off amazingly well, and here are a few things we can learn from her success.

1. **Take Decisive Action –** Tracy didn’t waste any time waiting to see how things went. The day they announced the split, they conducted a survey to find out how employees took the news (it was 70% positive or neutral). Monthly surveys have been administered since then to ensure employees understood the strategy for the separation and felt like they understood how it affected them.

2. **Focus Energy** – Early on, Tracy assessed all the HR initiatives being taken in the international corporation and found that about 250 were in effect that hadn’t even gotten off the ground. She put a halt to all of them and brought in a consistent, focused program.

3. **Develop Talent In-House –** When she found out that 65% of senior leaders were being recruited from outside the company, Tracy turned that around by making the leadership responsible for developing talent, rather than trying to keep their best people under their own control. Division managers were expected to identify and train new leaders.

4. **Power Up Company Culture –** Another way Tracy’s strong leadership helped pull the company out of tough times was in re-instituting company culture. “The HP Way” had lost meaning for employees. She rebranded it as “The HP Way Now,” and worked with HR leaders in 150 countries to get the program translated into the local languages. The result has been an increase in engagement and drop in voluntary turnover.
