# Benefits

## HR is all about people, not pushing paper.

Do you routinely hire hundreds of people in just a matter of weeks and deal with a mountain of paperwork during onboarding?
Do you spend seemingly never ending days chasing paperwork – making sure employee forms are complete, entering data into
your system, and then filing them in a safe place?

## You’re not alone.

Each year, US employers spend an astonishing $5.5 Billion on onboarding expenses. The average onboarding cost per
employee is $103. For a huge company like Baskin Robbins, onboarding comes at a whopping cost of $11 million per year.

We know your pain. We know the long, tedious, and costly processes that go with employee onboarding. We know because
we’ve been there, too.

## With WorkBright, you can:

* Onboard an employee from home, even before their first day of work!
* Automate form correction workflow
* Eliminate data entry
* Automate reminders
* Eliminate virtually all costs related to new hire paperwork
