A flip book is a visual set of cards that correlate one piece of text to an image that is easily readable and shareable. That means each 4×6″ card in this flip book contains one tip from a seasonal employer like yourself! If you like one particular idea, you can easily save that ‘card’ to send around to your team and say “I want to implement this!”.

**Here are a few previews of the cards in this flip book:**
