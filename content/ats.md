        <strong>Job Questions:</strong> Each position is unique. With each posting you can set up custom job questions that are asked during the application process that relate directly to the position. Questions are weighted so each applicant gets their own score for your team to review.

      {{< list_item_graphic >}}
        <strong>Auto Disqualify:</strong> If an applicant’s answer’s to your custom job questions are deal breakers – or if their score is below a minimum threshold – you can separate them into a disqualified pool. This removes the clutter but still makes them accessible to review for other positions!
